# Domingo Fermenter Lab

> An open-source fermenter that promotes fermented food and collaboration with natural processes.
 
At [Domingo Club](https://domingoclub.com/), we make fermented food, open-source tools and explore collaboration with natural processes to promote understanding, transparency, resilience and equity in our global food system.

We're developing an open-source fermenter that can be easily made anywhere using digital fabrication techniques and the global network of Fablabs / makerspaces. A fermenter is a device that maintains the necessary parameters, such as temperature and humidity, for an environment suitable for the growth of mycelium (the vegetative part of fungi) and microorganisms of all kinds. The Domingo Fermenter Lab can be used for the production of ferments, but also for bio-design and upcycling of organic matter.
