# Domingo Incubator

> An open-source incubator that promotes fermented food and collaboration with natural processes.
 
At [Domingo Club](https://domingoclub.com/), we make fermented food, open-source tools and explore collaboration with natural processes to promote understanding, transparency, resilience and equity in our global food system.

In order to do so, we're developing an open-source incubator that can be easily fabricated anywhere to promote fermented food everywhere.

An incubator is device that maintains the necessary parameters, such as temperature and humidity, for an environment suitable for the growth of mycelium (the vegetative part of fungi) and microorganisms of all kinds.
